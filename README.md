## Project Details

### 1. Authentication
- **Auth0** is used to handle authentication processes. Context API is employed to manage user authentication status and related information, making it easy to access authentication data throughout the application.

### 2. API Operations
- All product-related API operations are managed using **Redux Toolkit** with **createAsyncThunk** and **Axios**. Product data, loading states, and error states are all handled via Redux Toolkit, ensuring a consistent and centralized data flow within the application.

### 3. Design
- The entire application is designed with **Bootstrap 5**, ensuring a **fully responsive** layout.

### 4. Routing
- All routing within the application is managed using **React Router DOM**, allowing for smooth navigation between pages.

### 5. Tables and Table Functions
- The tables displaying products and related functions are created using **React Table**.
